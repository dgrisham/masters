## strategy-sim

The Bitswap strategy simulator repository is very related to this work -- see
[here](https://github.com/dgrisham/strategy-sim).

The [strategy analysis Mathematica notbook](./strategy-analysis.nb) sets up the
problem simulated by `strategy-sim` symbolically and finds the solutions
analytically. At the moment, only the linear reciprocation function is supported
in this notebook, as other reciprocation functions (e.g. `Tanh`) make the
problem intractable.
